For Data Structure Class Only

Firstly I do Seperate chaining hash base on your code in file 
1. Hash_Separate_Chaining.py

Next I do a project in Abstract Algebra class about Hungarian ring .
So I use BFS and DFS technique that I learned this is list of my file in that project.
1. Hungarian rings describe.py
2. Hungarian rings described (K=0).py


Lastly, I played it again by using this technique in Rubik's problem Just for fun.
1. Rubik3^3.py
